> In december 2017 I joined in a [Secret Santa event](https://www.facebook.com/events/189537648284407/) organised by [Henk Reickaert](http://www.henkrijckaert.be), amongst others known for his fun making endavours in the [Koterij](http://www.koterij.be).

This repository contains the [OpenSCAD model](src/pokemon.scad) with all four Pokemons, as well as the resulting [individual STL files](src/), and a copy of the [original STL files](lib/) I found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) by [Flowalistik](https://www.thingiverse.com/FLOWALISTIK/about).
